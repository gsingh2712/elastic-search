At the heart of ES is inverted index
Elastic Search is mostly used as an Analytics Engine -> this is called Aggregation 

How does indexing works?

1. Corpus of documents is collected
2. followed by tokenization of text into words in the corpus (multiple ways to do such , sample given below))
	1. Lower casing 
	2. Removing punctation
	3. splitting words
        4. Freq of Words 
        5. word index -> freq -> Soource Docs
	
        Sometimes word can split into substring to allow for all sorts of matches like yours can split like you , yours , your , our
