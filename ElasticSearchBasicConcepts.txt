Local machine mode:-
Untar the package version

cd  Users/gauravsingh/elastic-search/elasticsearch-5.4.0

./bin/elasticsearch -> Starts with default config settings 
	-> Cluster Name :- elasticsearch
	-> node Name:- (see logs)(random] -> node name [QXRCoXr] -> QXRCoXr

You multiple nodes to join same default cluster , by specifying the name of the cluster while starting the node

Ex-
./bin/elasticsearch -Ecluster.name=pluralsight_es -Enode.name=my_first_node
Starts a cluster with the name and node with the name 

Few Termenology :-
ES runs on a cluster with mutiple machines
Culster is a collection of nodes
Single server in the cluster is called node
Every node has a unique id
Every node participates in Search , indexing 
Nodes join the cluster using the cluster name
Nodes can communicate with each other
The machines have to be on same network

An index in ES is like a logical grouping , like index for Product Catalogs in e commerce
ES can have multiple indexes
Documents in ES is represented with JSON
Each doucment has type, a collection of similar documents is called index.
Document Type is collection of Doucments with similar characteristics/similar fields under a larger index
Document is the basic unit of information that is indexed expressed as json, it must have a type as well as an Index
Index and type are used to identify a set of documents
Spliting of an Index across multiple nodes is called sharding, meaning one node has only subset of index data 
Sharding is of an Index is done for search performance reasons as well as size bottleneck reason
