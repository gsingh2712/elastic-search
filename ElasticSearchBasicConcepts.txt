Local machine mode:-
Untar the package version

cd  Users/gauravsingh/elastic-search/elasticsearch-5.4.0

./bin/elasticsearch -> Starts with default config settings 
	-> Cluster Name :- elasticsearch
	-> node Name:- (see logs)(random] -> node name [QXRCoXr] -> QXRCoXr

You multiple nodes to join same default cluster , by specifying the name of the cluster while starting the node

Ex-
./bin/elasticsearch -Ecluster.name=pluralsight_es -Enode.name=my_first_node
Starts a cluster with the name and node with the name 

Few Termenology :-
ES runs on a cluster with mutiple machines
Culster is a collection of nodes
Single server in the cluster is called node
Every node has a unique id
Every node participates in Search , indexing 
Nodes join the cluster using the cluster name
Nodes can communicate with each other
The machines have to be on same network

An index in ES is like a logical grouping , like index for Product Catalogs in e commerce
ES can have multiple indexes
Documents in ES is represented with JSON
Each doucment has type,
Document Type is collection of Doucments with similar characteristics under a larger index
Sharding of indexes happen across multiple nodes, meaning one node has only subset of index data
